    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh spinach</li>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>half an onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3 ounces crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees C </li>
        <li> Heat butter in a large oven-safe skillet over high heat. Toss spinach in hot butter until wilted, about 30 seconds. Drain spinach well and squeeze it as dry as possible. Transfer to a cutting board and chop.</li> 
        <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper until thoroughly combined.  </li> 
        <li> Place bacon in the same skillet used to cook spinach and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until bacon has rendered its fat and is almost crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Use a paper towel held in a tongs to remove excess bacon grease. Reduce heat to medium; saute onion with bacon and a pinch of salt until onion is translucent, about 5 more minutes. </li> 
        <li>Saute chopped spinach with bacon and onion until spinach is hot; pour in eggs. Use a wooden spoon to distribute spinach evenly throughout the eggs. Sprinkle feta cheese over mixture.  </li> 
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, 10 to 15 minutes. Top may still be a little wet.  </li> 
        <li>Turn on oven's broiler. Broil pie until top is lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.  </li> 
    </ol>
